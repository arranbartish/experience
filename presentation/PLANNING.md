# Introduction

My name is Arran Bartish and I am one of the Dev leads at TEKsystems

I started leading teams in 2001 and started consulting in 2003.

Constantly moving around projects and domains I've fallen into being a generalist.
That either means I know a little about a lot or know very little about almost everything.


# What's the problem

Over the years i've worked on server rendered front ends more recently Single Page Applications.

- componetized and monolithic in both cases.

In either case our teams start off with the best of intentions.

- We're going to build the best application
- UX and design have built a vision based on research and user input
- We'll build an application that is totally in line with the that vision

We build the first instance of it and we get something that looks like this

It's a supersonic unicorn running on a rainbow. We love unicorns rainbows, they're pretty and magical... just like our UI

We're all rather proud of the result and we need to evolve it with what we've learned adding more features, maybe removing some. Then some how without us realising it we now have this.

Anyone know who this guy is? It's Sloth from The Goonies (1985)

Now we have a lot going on here

we've got:

- a little superman
- some pirate
- we've got... well we haven't got our unicorn or our rainbows
- maybe we still have our magic though, not sure

At this point we've probably got a dev team talking about technical debt, and the need for a rewrite. We've probably got some upset designers and UX folks who omce were excited and felt empowered by their magical rainbow powered unicorn. We may start trying to throw process at the problem:

- A pre idea meeting
- before development summary
- mid implementation review
- post implementation walk through
- post reimplementation critique
- Product owner demo... where it wasn't what he had in mind for product vision either

Eventually the team will drop tools and stop features to pay the debt. It may take an iteration or more to try and get the UI back to its former glory.

well maybe we might recapture the unicorn and the rainbow, but I think we might have lost the magic.

I love this image. I'm just going to leave it here for a bit.
